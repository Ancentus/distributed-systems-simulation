# Workstation Model

◦ Made of several work stations interconnected by a communication network.
◦ Each workstation is equipped with its own disk and serves a single user.
◦ Has the disadvantage that some stations lie idle (especially at night) thus wasting CPU as a resource.
◦ Solution is to interconnect the workstations by a high-speed LAN so that they may have sufficient processing power i.e., jobs partly transferred to another station for execution and then results returned to the original station.
