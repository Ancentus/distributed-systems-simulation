# Workstation â€“ server model:

- Is a network of personal workstations each with its own disk and a local file system.
- Consists of a few minicomputers and several workstations (some diskless and some diskfull) interconnected by a communication network.
- The minicomputers are basically used to provide one or more types of services e.g., file system, database service and print service.

- Compared to the workstation model, it has the following advantages:

a. It is much cheaper to use a few minicomputers equipped with large fast disks that are accessed over the network than a large number of diskfull workstations with each workstation having a small slow disk.

b. Diskless are preferred to diskfull workstations from a systems maintenance point of view e.g., in terms of h/ware, backup, s/ware installation etc.

c. Since all files are managed by the file servers, users have the flexibility to use any workstation and access the files in the same manner irrespective of which w/station a user is currently logged onto.

d. Does not need a process migration facility

e. User has guaranteed response time since w/stations are not used for executing remote processes (but the model does not use the processing capability of idle workstations).

f. V-system is an example.
